# NEON Beetle Part Masks ðŸª²

This dataset provides hand-labeled part segmentation annotations for Imageomics' [NEON Beetles Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imageomics/2018-NEON-beetles).

It includes 180 carefully labeled images with five part segmentation classes: Head, Pronotum, Elytra, Antenna, and Legs.

## Usage
A sample code for downloading the images and visualizing the masks can be found [here](demo.py).
